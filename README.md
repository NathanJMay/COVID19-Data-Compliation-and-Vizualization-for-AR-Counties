# COVID19-Data-Compliation-and-Vizualization-for-AR-Counties
Some of the first code I wrote. Designed to be run as a daily web-scraper with a ShinyApp component.

The webscraper pulls data, runs some calculations, and then deposits that into csv's for the Shiny App to pull and plot.

This was written before I discovered the beauty of ggplot2.

This project was never truly finished due to extentuating circumstances.

This was also before I knew any best practices for documentation and code commenting, but I think its cool to upload and see how I have developed.
